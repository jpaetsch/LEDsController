## Summary
The Android controller half of the code for an LED lights project. Provides instructions via Bluetooth to set up the lightstrip pattern.

## Setup & Usage
Download .ino Arduino file onto the Arduino board with a HC-05 Bluetooth module. Connect via Bluetooth with a phone with the app installed to control the LED lightstrip.

## Potential Improvements
Just getting started on this project; will update the README eventually with what can be improved on.

## Technologies
* API 28: Android 9.0 (Pie)
* MEGA2560 (not official Arduino but same hardware) board
* HC-05 Bluetooth module
* WS2812B LED lights
* C code (Arduino style)
* Power supply and a bunch of wiring to combat voltage drop
* FastLED library

## Inspiration
Wanted to set up a lightstrip and have it controllable by an app I program from my phone (also see the microcontroller receiver repository).  Also want to eventually connect to the Spotify API to automatically set the lights depending on songs, genres, etc and have 'smart, responsive' patterns.

## Sources
Online resources used extensively.  Code examples derived from to figure out the FastLED library and program Bluetooth functionality in Android.
